    <h2>üë§ About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jonathan, I‚Äôm a passionate and curious web developer who believes in the power of technology to transform lives. My journey into coding began out of sheer curiosity, and over time, that curiosity has grown into a deep commitment to building meaningful digital solutions.
I love solving problems, collaborating with like-minded thinkers, and pushing the boundaries of what I can create. Whether it‚Äôs designing a user interface or debugging a tough backend issue, I thrive on the challenge.</p>

   <section id="education">
        <h2>üéì Education Background</h2>
        <p>I hold a B.Sc. in Medical Biochemistry, a discipline that trained me to think critically, analyze complex systems, and understand intricate biological processes at the molecular level. My background in science sharpened my attention to detail and taught me how to approach problems logically, skills that seamlessly transitioned into my journey in tech.
While my formal education wasn‚Äôt rooted in programming, it laid the groundwork for analytical thinking and research-driven learning. Along the way, I developed a strong interest in technology and began exploring coding through self-study, online tutorials, and hands-on practice. I also tutored math and science remotely throughout university, which helped refine my communication skills and patience, both of which now serve me well in collaborative coding environments.
My CV outlines my academic training, tutoring experience, and the technical skills I‚Äôve acquired through dedicated personal learning and practical application.</p>

   <section id="interests">
    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Tech Interests</h2>
    <p>What excites me most about tech is its power to solve real-world problems and create opportunities. I‚Äôm particularly drawn to:</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Web development ‚Äì I enjoy building websites that feel clean, fast, and user-friendly.</li>
        <li>Automation with Python ‚Äì Writing scripts to automate manual tasks or organize information.</li>
        <li>Collaboration ‚Äì Whether in a hackathon or just a peer code review, I love bouncing ideas and improving things together.</li>
        <li>Learning emerging tech like AI, machine learning, and cloud infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Educational tech ‚Äì Tools that make learning easier, from task managers to result trackers.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

   <section id="projects">
    <h2>üß™ Projects</h2>
    <p>Here are a few of the projects I‚Äôve worked on. Each one represents a unique problem I set out to solve using code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Study Planner & Tracker ‚Äì A self-built tool to help students manage their workload. Inspired by the struggles I saw during my tutoring sessions, this project aimed to organize study time and track goals.</li>
        <li>Python Result Organizer ‚Äì A console-based tracker for teachers to manage and calculate student scores. It was one of my first logic-heavy projects in Python and helped me explore file handling, data structures, and basic output formatting.</li>
        <li>To-Do List (Task Manager) ‚Äì A JavaScript project that lets users add, remove, and mark tasks as complete. It stores data locally, making it persistent without a database.</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS Portfolio Site ‚Äì A clean, responsive personal website built with no frameworks, just raw HTML and CSS to showcase my journey.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These projects weren‚Äôt perfect, but they were real. They represent my steady climb from zero knowledge to building things that work, things that solve real problems.</p>
